Language Specification of CODE Programming Language
Introduction
CODE is a strongly – typed programming language developed to teach Junior High School students basics of
programming. It was developed by a group of students enrolled in the Programming Languages course. CODE is a pure
interpreter.
Sample Program:
# this is a sample program in CODE
BEGIN CODE
INT x, y, z=5
CHAR a_1=’n’
BOOL t=”TRUE”
x=y=4
a_1=’c’
# this is a comment
DISPLAY: x & t & z & $ & a_1 & [#] & “last”
END CODE
Output of the sample program:
4TRUE5
n#last
Language Grammar
Program Structure:
- all codes are placed inside BEGIN CODE and END CODE
- all variable declaration is found after BEGIN CODE
- all variable names are case sensitive and starts with letter or an underscore (_) and followed by a letter,
underscore or digits.
- every line contains a single statement
- comments starts with sharp sign(#) and it can be placed anywhere in the program
- executable codes are placed after variable declaration
- all reserved words are in capital letters and cannot be used as variable names
- dollar sign($) signifies next line or carriage return
- ampersand(&) serves as a concatenator
- the square braces([]) are as escape code
Data Types:
1. INT – an ordinary number with no decimal part. It occupies 4 bytes in the memory.
2. CHAR – a single symbol.
3. BOOL – represents the literals true or false.
4. FLOAT – a number with decimal part. It occupies 4 bytes in the memory.
Operators:
Arithmetic operators
()
- parenthesis
*, /, %
- multiplication, division, modulo
+, -
- addition, subtraction
>, <
- greater than, lesser than
>=, <= - greater than or equal to, lesser than or equal to
==, <>
- equal, not equal
Logical operators (<BOOL expression><LogicalOperator><BOOL expression>)
AND
- needs the two BOOL expression to be true to result to true, else false
OR
- if one of the BOOL expressions evaluates to true, returns true, else false
NOT
- the reverse value of the BOOL value
Unary operator
+
- positive
-
- negative
